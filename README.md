# js-zlib

js-zlib is a port of zlib to JavaScript.

NOTE: **js-zlib is very much *incomplete***. I'm terribly sorry if you found this project, looking for a zlib implementation in JavaScript, as I was once in your shoes, which is why I started this project in the first place. Unfortunately, my priorities shifted quite a bit and I don't know when I'll have time to continue working on this, though I very much do want to finish it. Best of luck.
